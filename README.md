## Introduction
Water is a valuable resource, and its conservation is critical for long-term development. Domestic families typically use water storage tanks to store water for everyday use. To prevent overflow and to guarantee that there is always adequate water in the tank, the water level in these tanks must be monitored and controlled. It is possible to do this manually, but it is inconvenient and time-consuming. As a result, an automatic water level controller is required. To ensure water availability while minimising waste, the water level in these tanks must be monitored and controlled. Traditionally, this was done manually by checking the tank on a regular basis and changing the water flow accordingly.This method, however, is not only inconvenient, but also prone to human error, potentially resulting in overflows or water shortages. An automatic water level controller is a feasible method for addressing these difficulties. This gadget employs a variety of technologies and sensors to precisely measure the water level in the tank and manage the input and outflow of water. By automating the process, users save time and effort by eliminating the need for ongoing manual monitoring. The automatic water level controller is programmed to work depending on preset parameters such as desired maximum and minimum water levels. When the water level exceeds the upper limit, the controller initiates a mechanism that stops the input of water, so preventing overflow. Similarly, when the water level falls below the lower threshold, the controller activates the inflow to ensure a sufficient supply. An automatic water level controller provides other benefits in addition to reducing waste and guaranteeing a steady supply of water. It optimises the use of water resources, protecting this valuable resource and promoting environmentally friendly practises. It also decreases the risk of property damage from spilling water and aids in the prevention of waterborne diseases by ensuring the availability of clean water. Overall, the adoption of automatic water level controllers in domestic houses promotes efficient water management, increases convenience, and contributes to long-term development. We can save this critical resource while meeting our daily water needs by utilising technology to automate the monitoring and control of water levels.
## Working on Project
